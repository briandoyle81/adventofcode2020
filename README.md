My solutions to the advent of code 2020.

I've left these in the state they were in when I got them working, in case I
decide to use this as an example of the "quality" of work "real" developers do
when they're figuring stuff out.

I would clean it up before submitting if this was for an interview.

I'd also convert most of this to functions if it was real code.
